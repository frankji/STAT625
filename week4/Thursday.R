# Case Studies, Thursday September 22
#
# - 10 minutes, run fixed ownership code on the sample properties.
#   Call the resulting file `Ownership_netid.csv` and it should have
#   10 rows and 15 columns.  Call your script `Ownership_netid.R`.
#   Upload both to Dropbox.com.
#
# - Sharing and discussion of geocoding.
#
# - We have a 3rd source with thanks to Susan!  This is in Week4,
#   called ArcGISgeocoded.csv.
#
# - New variable 'locquality': you may use a scale from 0-5.
#   If we have no lat/lon at all (i.e. if NA) this should be NA.
#   If we have lat/lon but think it is absolutely terrible,
#   this should be 0.  A 5 we feel is perfect.  Up to you on
#   how to use the rest of the scale.
#
# - Go back to work.  You now have three geocoding results to consider!
#
# - Integrate geocoding with property characteristics, doing your
#   best at both, fixing problems, etc... so that by Tuesday you have
#   your own personal best attempt at assembling this data set.
#
# - Tuesday: 27307 rows, 41 + 3 ('latitude', 'longitude', 'locquality')
#          =====>>>>>>>> 44 columns
#
# - Upload by 8 AM, named             NH_netid.csv
