# Case Studies: New Haven totval prediction
# October 6, 2016
#
# Using your fellow student's code, train your model or procedure
# using the training data set, and then do predictions and other
# stuff for the test set.
#
# Produce a new file, NH_PredTest_8.csv, if, for example, you were
# given file number 8.  If you can't do this, see the next instructions.
#
# As you go through their code, add comments.  Be critical of coding
# clarity and style.  When you make a comment, if your netid is netid,
# use the following convention.  If you are unable to do the predictions,
# add comments to explain the source of your troubles.
#

### netid ### Comment on its own line...
hist(rnorm(10))                   ### netid ### Comment about this line...

# Upload NH_PredTest_8.csv and the commented NH_Prediction_8.R to your
# Dropbox folder.  Obviously change the 8 to whatever number you are
# assigned.
#
# DONE EARLY?  Go repeat this exercise with the training/test data with
# your own personal script and evaluate your own performance.  But do
# this in your own folder, don't change anything you did with your own
# files on Dropbox.
#
# Still done early?  Go talk with Susan or Jay.
