# Property owners in New Haven pay high taxes (high relative to most
# cities in the US).  And when you write a big check you have to wonder
# if it's "fair".  What is meant by "fair"?  HINT: Fairness has nothing to
# do with what is happening in other cities (and we have no data on other
# cities for this project, anyway).  Fairness is a local issue.

# Every property has some official total value that is the basis for property
# taxes, because property taxes are set at some amount per $1000 of value.
# So if your property is valued at $100,000 for tax purposes and the city
# "mil rate" is $40, then your taxes would be $4000 per year.  FYI in
# New Haven, the total value (appraised) that we collected is multiplied by
# 0.7 to get an "assessed value" and then the current mil rate is about $42.
# This level of detail is irrelevant here for our purposes.
# 
# Suppose a client hires you to study this issue.  The client hopes that
# your study will show that the official appraised value listed in the city
# database is "too high" so the taxes are "not fair" and could be challenged
# either with the tax office or, if necessary, in a lawsuit.  What would you
# do?
#
# We have a wealth of information on every property.  We have some information
# on past sales.  However, although past sales could be useful, they are not
# tied directly to the city's measure of total value.  At best they are tied
# indirectly to this measure and the observed sales information might be used
# about once a decade to recalibrate the appraised values.
#
# Recommendation: choose one residential property in the city and imagine this
# is your client.  Think about the problem.
