# STAT 325/625: Week 2 for Thursday 9/8
#
# DROPBOX.COM: This will be much easier for everyone than ClassesV2
# for some things.  If you don't have an account, please create one.
# The free level will be fine.  Create a folder that you'll use *only*
# for exchanging files with us -- do not work in this folder!  That would
# create lots of annoying network traffic.  Once a task is complete, copy
# your solution into this folder.  We ask that the folder be called
# (625 or 325)_netid.  So if you are in 625 and your netid is xx123,
# your folder should be 625_xx123.  Issue a share for this folder to
# Jay (john.emerson@yale.edu) or Susan (swang87@gmail.com).
#
# Go back and redo your Homework 1.  Then add the following variables
# to expand your data scrape: the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and
# half baths (these three appear to have separate total counts).  A
# half bath is a bathroom with a toilet and a sink but no tub or shower.
# Use variable names 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'halfbaths'.
#
# When you are done, you should have the same 27307 rows but now a total of
# 6 columns.  Please make sure all the columns (other than location) are
# numeric, and sorted by the parcel id (column 'pid' from before).
#
# This file should still be called hw1.csv as before.  Upload it to this new
# dropbox.com folder (created above, properly shared) along with your script
# by 8 AM this Thursday morning.  Again, please don't use subfolders.
#
# IMPORTANT: when you put stuff into this dropbox.com folder, make sure you
# are placing a COPY there, not doing a MOVE.  Your master copy of your work
# should be organized elsewhere.  We reserve the right to flush out these
# folders, deleting their contents.  You don't want to really lose your work.
